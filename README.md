# My Next.js Forum with PayPal Store

Welcome to my Next.js forum! This forum is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. It has an integrated PayPal store that allows users to purchase products, and a product management system that enables you to manage your store's inventory. The forum has features such as likes, posts, pinned posts, comments, and a landing page. The forum is responsive and uses Tailwind for styling. We use Prisma as our ORM to interact with our MySQL database, and Axios to make HTTP requests from our Next.js server.
